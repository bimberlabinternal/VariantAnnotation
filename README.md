# VariantAnnotation

A set of scripts to build custom funcotator-compatible data sources

# Usage

The script initializeAll.sh is designed to iterate the subfolders and build each source. As a convenience, the script runInitializeTest.sh can be run, which will only download the first 1000 lines of each data source.
